# Implementation of ResNet using PyTorch

## Todos
- [x] Dataloaders for TinyImageNet, Dogs and Cifar10
- [x] Train with imported ResNet from torchvision
- [x] Implement residual block
- [x] Resnet34
- [ ] Hyper-Parameters via CLI
- [ ] Save logs and checkpoints with hyperparameters in name
- [ ] Image preprocessing
- [ ] Evaluate on Tiny Imagenet
- [ ] Build Resnet50 (resnet34 with bottlenecks)
- [ ] Evaluate again o Tiny Imagenet
- [ ] Try Dogs and Cifar10 (follow paper for cifar10)
