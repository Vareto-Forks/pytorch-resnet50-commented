# Implementation of ResNet using PyTorch

## Todos
- [x] Dataloaders for TinyImageNet, Dogs and Cifar10
- [x] Train with imported ResNet from torchvision
- [x] Implement residual block
- [x] Resnet34
- [x] Hyper-Parameters via CLI
- [x] Save logs and checkpoints with hyperparameters in name
- [x] Evaluate on Tiny Imagenet
- [x] Image preprocessing
- [x] Build Resnet50 (resnet34 with bottlenecks)
- [x] Evaluate again o Tiny Imagenet
- [x] Try Dogs and Cifar10 (follow paper for cifar10)
- [x] Implement ResNet50 with pre-activation
- [x] Implement ResNext29
